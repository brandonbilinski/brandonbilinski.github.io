                <ul>
                    <li>Stood up Power BI dashboards to visualize all results from testing, investigate and create connections between tracking systems to visualize burndown of issues</li>
                    <li>Migrated dashboards from local Power BI server to Cloud BI to utilize many-to-many relationship functionality not previously available.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Architected and implemented data pipeline to address bottleneck in data visualization. Centralized storage of data onto NAS and hardened push system.</li>
                    <li>Updated windows service to address issues when importing new versions of push script.</li>
                    <li>Expanded pipeline to handle new types of tests, auto organizing into storage, as well as served as a liaison for best practices when creating new tests and data storage requirements.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Explored process analysis through the full life cycle of development to identify gaps.</li>
                    <li>Implemented rudimentary correlation analysis of issue tracking system, “obsolete” issues, and their propagation through to customer warranty claims.</li>
                    <li>Utilized MiniLM-L6 to build association between vehicle location category in issue tracking and warranty labor code descriptions to show 1:1 causation of no-fix issues.</li>
                    <li>Improved on single pass results of syntactic association by developing iterative best case algorithm to go from 40% to 60% similarity scores above 51.</li>
                    <li>Building traditional ML model to predict program performance based on its state during different phases of development to red light/green light based on previous launches.</li>
                    <li>Investigated internally trained LLMs to provide feedback on usability and accuracy.</li>
