                Well hey there, first off, thanks for checking out this page! <br>
                This is my first website that I've designed completely by myself <br>
                So it's pretty cool that I got something up that even looks moderately like a website<br>
                To give you a little bit about me...<br> <br>
                I am a twenty something engineer, placed in a job that really doesn't cut it for me, but it pays the bills.<br>
                I love data and the idea of using data to improve things around us. I truly believe there are so many stories around us<br>
                just waiting to be discovered. If you want to be a part of that data collection, maybe fill out <s>this survey. </s> <br>
                I dabble in painting, drawing, ceramics, photography, and poetry. I feel like I have a lot on my heart and not enough time to show it <br>
                It is my wish that through this process of creating my website, I not only build a professional portfolio, but I also discover a little more <br>
                About what I want out of this experience, while showing all of the places I've explored. Thanks for being a part of that, I hope you do the same.
